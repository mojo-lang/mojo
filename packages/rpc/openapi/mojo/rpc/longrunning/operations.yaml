        It is related to Timestamp in that the difference between two Timestamp values is a Duration and
        it can be added or subtracted from a Timestamp. Range is approximately +-10,000 years.

        An attribute is a piece of metadata that describes an activity on a network
        service. For example, the size of an HTTP request, or the status code of
        an HTTP response.

        Each attribute has a type and a name, which is logically defined as
        a proto message field in `AttributeContext`. The field type becomes the
        attribute type, and the field path becomes the attribute name. For example,
        the attribute `source.ip` maps to field `AttributeContext.source.ip`.

        This message definition is guaranteed not to have any wire breaking change.
        So you can use it directly for passing attributes across different systems.

        NOTE: Different system may generate different subset of attributes. Please
        verify the system specification before relying on an attribute generated
        a system.

                `//pubsub.googleapis.com/projects/123/topics/news-feed`.
            *   URI often includes protocol and version information, so it can
                be used directly by applications. For example,
                `https://pubsub.googleapis.com/v1/projects/123/topics/news-feed`.

  description: When an API method normally takes long time to complete, it can be
    designedto return [Operation][google.longrunning.Operation] to the client, and
    the client can use thisinterface to receive the real response asynchronously by
    polling theoperation resource, or pass the operation resource to another API (such
    asGoogle Cloud Pub/Sub API) to receive the response.  Any API service thatreturns
    long-running operations should implement the `Operations` interfaceso developers
    can have a consistent client experience.
