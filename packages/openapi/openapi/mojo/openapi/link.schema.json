    "description": "The Link object represents a possible design-time link for a response. The presence of a link does not guarantee the caller's ability to successfully invoke it, rather it provides a known relationship and traversal mechanism between responses and other operations.\n\nUnlike dynamic links (i.e. links provided in the response payload), the OAS linking mechanism does not require link information in the runtime response.\n\nFor computing links, and providing instructions to execute them, a runtime expression is used for accessing values in an operation and using them as parameters while invoking the linked operation.\n\nA linked operation MUST be identified using either an operationRef or operationId. In the case of an operationId, it MUST be unique and resolved in the scope of the OAS document. Because of the potential for name clashes, the operationRef syntax is preferred for specifications with external references.\n",
